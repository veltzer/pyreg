- make the 'extension_stats' command do recursive option to traverse
	the folder recursively (currently it only works with arguments
	from the command line and the user must use find(1) or something
	to do recursive scan).
- to a tool to compare structure of yaml and json files
	use idea from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61671552/javascript-how-to-compare-only-keys-and-not-values-of-json
- add command which creates a histogram of extensions of files in a folder.
- make setup.py be made out of a template.
- add a utility to remove non ascii characters from a file (with a report
	about how many characters were removed, etc).
	make it run on compressed files also
	and return them to their compressed state.
- add a utility to max the screen resolution (of any screen which is active).
- add a tool to show progress by pointing to a FILE and not a PROCESS NAME or PID.
	If you point to a file then something like fuser(1) should be called
	on the file, and if there is just one process holding the file open
	then show the progress on that file.
